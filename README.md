# Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction & Anomaly Detection Report

---
A machine learning pipeline for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines using NASA CMAPSS data, and detecting anomalies based on prediction errors. Includes feature engineering, model training, anomaly detection, and visual reporting.
---

## Project Objective
Develop a machine learning pipeline to:
- Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines.
- Detect anomalies based on prediction errors.

---

## Data & Features
- Dataset: NASA CMAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset
https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository
- Rolling features: 5-cycle rolling mean and std of sensor readings
- Final feature count: 47 (after adding rolling features and dropping constants)

---

## Final Model
- Model: Random Forest Regressor
- RÂ²: 0.7431
- MAE: 23.59
- RMSE: 34.26
- Best features: Rolling mean & std of key sensors (e.g., sensor_4, sensor_11, sensor_9)

---

## Anomaly Detection
- Method: IQR-based thresholding of prediction error
- Threshold: 35.68
- Total anomalies detected: 1306

---

## Visual Insights
- Prediction Error over Cycles: See `cycle_anomaly_plot.png`
- Prediction Error by Unit Number: See `unit_anomaly_plot.png`

---

## Exported Files
- `anomalies_detected.csv`: List of detected anomalies with unit, cycle, RUL, prediction, error

---

## Next Steps
- Optional hyperparameter tuning
- Alternative anomaly thresholds (e.g. z-score)
- Deployment as a script or microservice
